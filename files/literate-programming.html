        <p> <em>Literate programming</em> is a method of crafting software that Don Knuth described in 1984 in his paper <a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf">Literate Programming</a>. A literate program places emphasis on the way that people understand the problem a particular piece of software is attempting to solve, rather than the way that computers interpret the source code.</p>

<p> This is an example of literate-style programming using <a href="https://github.com/rtomayko/rocco">Rocco</a>. This <code>literate-programming.html</code> file is the output of running <code>rocco content/literate-programming.rb</code> from the root directory of the <a href="https://github.com/judofyr/timeless">Timeless source code</a>. You can also view <a href="/literate-programming.rb">literate-programming.rb</a> directly.</p>

 to write a <code>method_missing</code> that simply catches all unnamed methods and

 basically it&rsquo;s what lets my illustrations later work without causing

        <p> I&rsquo;m sure that at your shop, it looks a little bit different. You care about
 documentation, because you know that when you have to look at your code
 later, or when you have to bring a new member on board, you have an education
 problem. The knowledge was either forgotten or was never there in the first
 place, and now you&rsquo;ve gotta have it. So what do you do? Documentation. That
 way, when that new hire is learning her way around the codebase, she can just
 read your documentation!</p>

        <h2>Documentation afterward</h2>

<p> I initially became a big fan of test-first development methodologies when
 I came to terms with something about myself: As soon as my code &lsquo;works,&rsquo;
 I feel like it&rsquo;s done. I want to ship it out the door. I also feel this way
 about writing; I find editing myself after the fact to be a bit tedious, and
 it&rsquo;s difficult for me to be as hard on myself as I should be. It&rsquo;s already
 written, just post it already!</p>

<p> That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m a big fan of putting off coding to the absolute last part of
 a project. Here&rsquo;s some things I&rsquo;d rather be doing before writing code:</p>

<ul>
<li>Thinking about the problem that I&rsquo;m going to solve, and different ways of
solving it.</li>
<li>Investigating similar solutions that others have used in the past.</li>
<li>Writing automated tests.</li>
<li>Writing documentation.</li>

        <p> Yep, that&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;m not perfect at this, but lately I&rsquo;ve come to the
 conclusion that documentation is important enough that I need to do it
 <em>first</em>, otherwise, it&rsquo;ll never get done. Tom Preston-Warner says it better
 than I can in
 <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html">README driven development</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Consider the process of writing the Readme for your project as the true act of creation. This is where all your brilliant ideas should be expressed. This document should stand on its own as a testament to your creativity and expressiveness. The Readme should be the single most important document in your codebase; writing it first is the proper thing to do.</p></blockquote>

        <p> Ugh! I mean, this is <em>sort</em> of correct, but probably not what you were
 expecting.</p>

<p> This problem is a subtle one. Nobody sets out to write poor explanations. In
 fact, I bet the first version of the <code>pi</code> method probably looked like this:</p>

        </div>
        <p> But then, as times change, the <code>pi</code> method need to change, too. Now,
 changing the value of <code>pi</code> seems really stupid, but maybe your new programmer
 is a junior. Or you&rsquo;re coding while drinking. Or you&rsquo;ve just plain had a bad
 day, and aren&rsquo;t thinking straight. Nobody is at the top of their game 100% of
 the time. This is where the danger lies: Your code and your documentation
 gets out of synch. It happens to the best of us.</p>

<p> The easiest way to make sure that your documentation stays up to date is to
 keep it as close as possible to the code that you&rsquo;re changing. If the
 description is staring you in the face, it&rsquo;s harder to ignore.</p>

<p> We have tools to aid you in doing this. Docco is one of them. RDoc or JavaDoc
 are others. They extract the comments that you write and turn them into
 webpages, so that you can share them with others.</p>

        <p> While tools like Docco are fantastic, they&rsquo;re not <em>real</em> literate
 programming. Literate software means more than just &ldquo;cleverly pull comments
 out of code and turn it into HTML.&rdquo; To truly understand literate programming,
 we need to consider the nature of what combining code and documentation
 actually means. Knuth gives us a clue:</p>

<blockquote><p>The main point is that [a literate program] is inherently bilingual, and
 that such a combination of languages proves to be much more powerful than
 either single language by itself. [Literate programming] does not make the
 other languages obsolete; on the contrary, it enhances them.</p></blockquote>

        <p> This duality is incredibly important in understanding why literate
 programming is actually different from what&rsquo;s been done before; it&rsquo;s an
 observation that gets to the core of what it means to write software. One of
 my favorite quotes on software comes from the preface of the first edition of
 <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.</p></blockquote>

        <p> But unfortunately, while human languages are excellent at describing broad
 ideas, they&rsquo;re generally poor at the exact specifics that computers need to
 do their job properly. Programming languages have the opposite problem in
 that they&rsquo;re excellent for computers, but it&rsquo;s difficult for humans to
 discern the larger picture from a body of code. Literate programming aims to
 rectify this impedance mismatch by combining the two into a single body of
 work. Knuth refers to this work as a <em>web</em>, and while he claims that he chose
 this name in a quite informal manner, it&rsquo;s an incredibly apt name that has
 subtle implications we&rsquo;ll explore in a moment. From a <em>web</em> you can use
 a tool named <em>weave</em> to generate a file suitable for generating more
 traditional documentation, and you can use the <em>tangle</em> tool to produce
 a body of code suitable for compilation.</p>

        <p> Earlier, I mentioned that literate programming is more than simply extracting
 comments. The important thing that Docco is missing are <em>macros</em>. Literate
 programming macros are similar to the concept of macros in other languages;
 they are simply a name that&rsquo;s given to a piece of code, such that it can be
 substituted by the preprocessor. The reason macros are important is that
 allows code to be declared out of the order that the computer requires, and

        <div class='highlight'><pre><span class="n">calculate</span> <span class="n">user_input</span>

        </div>
        <p> you would generate an error. You need to define the <code>calculate</code> method before
 you used it, and the same with <code>user_input</code>. It&rsquo;s all out of order! But maybe
 this way makes the most sense when we&rsquo;re trying to explain the program.
 Macros would allow us to say something like:</p>

        <pre><code> The meat of the program is in the calculation on the user input. Since it's
 the main thing we're trying to do, it's simple: just one line:
 &lt;1&gt;
 calculate user_input

        </div>
        <p> And so on. We could then explain each section in the order we want, and our
 <em>tangle</em> program will re-arrange them into the order that the computer needs.
 Knuth considered this incredibly important, enough that systems that don&rsquo;t
 have this ability would not actually be called literate systems.</p>

        <h2>Code as a web.</h2>

<p> At first glance, a simple ordering of code seems to be a quite minor feature.
 However, it represents a deeper structural difference between the way that we
 understand concepts and the way that a computer does; the human mind tends to
 think of things as an interconnected network of concepts, and a computer
 only understands ordered lists of commands. This relationship is one of the
 fundamental leaks in the software abstraction.</p>

<blockquote><p>I think that a complex piece of software is, indeed, best regarded as a web that has been delicately pieced together from simple materials. We understand a complicated system by understanding its simple parts, and by understanding the simple relations between those parts and their immediate neighbors. If we express a program as a web of ideas, we can emphasize its structural properties in a natural and satisfying way.</p></blockquote>

<p> Trading off understanding simply to make it easier for a computer to
 interpret our program makes no sense; man has mastery over machine. It&rsquo;s hard
 enough to create reliable programs without artificial impediments in our way!
 This is a major structural shift, and dramatically increases our ability to
 express what we want a program to do, rather than simply describe how the
 computer understands our source code.</p>

        <h2>So is all of this worth it?</h2>

<p> Knuth seems to think so:</p>

<blockquote><p>Programming is a very personal activity, so I can&rsquo;t be certain that what
 has worked for me will work for everybody. Yet the impact of this new
 approach on my own style has been profound, and my excitement has continued
 unabated for more than two years. I enjoy the new methodology so much that it
 is hard for me to refrain from going back to every program that I&rsquo;ve ever
 written and recasting it in &ldquo;literate&rdquo; form.</p></blockquote>

<p> Time will tell. I know that I&rsquo;ve been searching for a better way to blend
 documentation and code together, and it seems like tools such as Docco are
 almost there. I&rsquo;ve already converted the Hackety Hack website over to Docco,
 and I&rsquo;ve enjoyed it a lot. I&rsquo;m not 100% convinced that it&rsquo;s the best
 solution that exists, but it sounds appealing, and my results have been good
 so far.</p>

<p> If you have significant experience programming in a literate style, I&rsquo;d love
 to <a href="http://timeless.judofyr.net/comments">hear from you</a>. Also, there is
 a small chance that I&rsquo;d like to build a macro system on top of Docco, so if
 that interests you, please get in touch and we can talk about it.</p>
