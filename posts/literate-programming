*Literate programming* is an interesting concept that Don Knuth described in
1984, as an alternate way to write software. Literate programming places
emphasis on the way that people think about software, rather than the way
that computers do. Rather than write code in an order that's imposed by the
compiler, the literate programmer writes in words the way he expects a
program to work, and then intersperses his description with code.
