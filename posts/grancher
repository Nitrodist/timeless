Title: Grancher
Subtitle: Easily Copy Folders to a Git Branch
Author: judofyr

[GitHub Pages][pages] is a pretty cool feature which allows you to publish web
content to a github.com subdomain named after your username. It automatically
serves everything you have located under the `gh-pages` branch, so you can use
Git to update the site.

However, what do you do when you already got your website/docs/whatever in your
master branch? If you checkout the gh-pages branch, the folder disappears.
You'll actually have to copy the folder to another place before you checkout
the new branch and copies the folder into that branch.

It's [even harder][gh-pages] if you haven't created the gh-pages branch yet.

## Grancher

Okey, enter Grancher (yeah, I know, lame name):

    # Install:
    system('sudo gem install grancher')

    # Create a Rakefile:
    require 'grancher/task'
    
    Grancher::Task.new do |g|
      g.branch = 'gh-pages'
      g.push_to = 'origin' # automatically push too
      
      g.directory 'website'
    end
{: lang=ruby }

Do a `rake publish` and the folder will be copied to the gh-pages branch,
committed and pushed. Easy peasy! Have a look at [the documentation][grancher]
to get started. Report any bugs at [GitHub][grancher-bugs].
