It was first [introduced][haiku] by Why The Lucky Stiff in 2005 with this
wonderful haiku:

          "eyes".scan /the_darkness/
    catch( :in_the_wind ) { ?a.round; "breath" \
            or "a".slice /of_moon/ }      
{: lang=ruby }

greasygreasy followed up with this:

    def you are
      false
    end

    enjoy life while you /can/  
{: lang=ruby }

M didn't want miss the party:

    class Starts < AndThenWe
      raise "questions" and require "thought"
    end if "we".rjust
{: lang=ruby }

[U Nakamura came up with a genius one:][rehaiku]

    $ruby.is_a?(Object){|oriented| language}
{: lang=ruby }

[Evan Weaver sort of created one:][mm]

    for desires in heaven do not always end or fade
{: lang=ruby }

A silly one I wrote a few years ago:

    def initely(awesome, haiku)
     "should".match /your style/ and [:in, :the]
    end rescue 007  
{: lang=ruby }

[Evan Short][falling] wrote a bit about falling (not technically a haiku,
but I'm not very picky when it comes to awesome code):

    #- - - - - - - - - - - - - -#
    #                           #
    #    a bit about falling    #
    #       by: evan            #
    #                           #
    #- - - - - - - - - - - - - -#

    # first of all:
    def it_is_ok
    #   ok?
              "ok."
    end

    # but:
    #   when a thing
    def   hits_the_ground_from the_height
    #       if we can assume that the
                remaining_energy = the_height

    #   then we can say 
          if remaining_energy
              that_the "thing uses some of the #{remaining_energy} to bounce"
    #            and
                rises_to the_next_peak_from(the_height)

          else
    #     the thing just
          rests
    #     and that is the
          end # of it
    end

    # it should be noted that:

    #    in order to determine the
    def    the_next_peak_from the_old_height;
             unless the_old_height < 0.01
    #           we assume that
           new_height = the_old_height * 0.5
             else
    #          the thing is no longer bouncing
    #             percievable to this observer, anyway...
      end
    end

    # also, 
    #    when a thing
    #      is dropped
    def     from a_height # it 
                  hits_the_ground_from a_height
    end

    # likewise,
    #    when a thing
    def   rises_to a_new_height
    #       then it will fall
              from a_new_height

    end

    #                 but...
    # and most importantly.
    #           when the time is just right,
    #        the thing just
    def          rests;

                      and_we_know it_is_ok

                           #the
                           end

    #----------------------------------------------#

                            alias :and_we_know :puts
                            alias :that_the    :puts
{: lang=ruby }

[herval] certainly knows his Shakespear:

    question = !!(:to_be or not :to_be)  
{: lang=ruby }

[smackywentz] has a nice description of Rails:

    class RubyOnRails
      has_many :features, :through => :bugs
    end
{: lang=ruby }

[Jacques Fuentes][jac] has a beautiful letter to his daugther:

    require "./love"

    a_letter to: Augusta do
      twas(only: 16.months.ago) { The::Universe << You.to(OurFamily) }
      life.has :been => %w(i n c r e d i b l y).zip(*"wonderful!").ever_since
      We::Wish.we_could { experience these_moments: over & over }
      You.will always_be: Loved, and: Cherished
      until Infinity.ends do; Forever.(); end
    end
{: lang=ruby }

Please [let me know](/comments) if you have another one I can add.
