Title: SexpBuilder
Subtitle: Easily process and rewrite S-expressions using SexpPath
Author: judofyr

*NOTE: In this post I use the term "S-expression" and "Sexp" quite a lot. If
you're not quite sure what they mean, check out [Sexp for
Rubyists](/sexp-for-rubyists).*

I very often use Air Castle Driven Development. So when I see something like
this:

    def process_call(exp)
      # exp[1] => reciever.
      # exp[2] => method
      # exp[3] => (args)
      exp[3] = process(exp[3])
      if text?(exp)
        s(:parkaby, :text, exp[3])
      elsif tag = force_tag_call?(exp) || tag_call?(exp)
        s(:parkaby, :tag, *tag)
      else
        exp
      end
    end
{: lang=ruby }

I just write down what I want it to look like:

    rule :tag_call do
      # Forced tag call
      s(:call,
       s(:call, nil, :tag, s(:arglist)),
       wild % :name,
       args % :args) |

      # or regular tag call
      s(:call,
      nil,
      name % :name,
      args % :args)
    end

    rule :text do
      s(:call, nil,      :text, s(:arglist, wild % :content)) |
      s(:call, s(:self), :<<,   s(:arglist, wild % :content))
    end
{: lang=ruby }

Then I know I have a useful API and I can start implement it. Okay, the
examples above aren't quite equal, so let's have a look at what I'm really
trying to solve.

## Matching complex Sexp in Parkaby

[Parkaby](/parkaby) is my little experiment to create a super-duper-feaky-fast
Markaby replacement by parsing the source and "compiling" it. Ultimately, a
template like this:

    h1 "Hello World!"
    p "Welcome #{@user}"
{: lang=ruby }

Should be compiled into:

    "<h1>Hello World!</h1><p>Welcome #{@user}</p>"
{: lang=ruby }

In Parkaby, this is accomplished in two steps: A *processor* which figues out
what should be considered HTML-tags and what should be considered regular
method calls, and a *generator* which compiles it back into Ruby.

An interesting aspect of Parkaby is that the processor is actually quite
complex. For instance, it has to figure out that
`div.post.clearfix.main!(:style => "display:none")` should be compiled to `<div
class="post clearfix" id="main" style="display:none"></div>`.

My origianl approach was to use SexpProcessor:

    def process_call(exp)
      # exp[1] => reciever.
      # exp[2] => method
      # exp[3] => (args)
      exp[3] = process(exp[3])
      if text?(exp)
        s(:parkaby, :text, exp[3])
      elsif tag = force_tag_call?(exp) || tag_call?(exp)
        s(:parkaby, :tag, *tag)
      else
        exp
      end
    end
{: lang=ruby }

Every time it finds a method call, it checks if it's a text-code or a HTML-tag
(and then turns it into a parkaby-sexp), or it just leaves it alone. The code
ended up quite messy, and it's before I even tried to implement CSS-proxies
(`tag.klass.klass.klass.id!`): [Parkaby before SexpBuilder][before].

## Adam Samderson to the rescue!

Ka-poof! Adam Sanderson writes [SexpPath][sexp_path], a simple DSL for matching
Sexp.

Let's say we want to match `text "Hello"` and `self << "Hello"`:

    # text "Hello"
    sexp1 = s(:call, nil, :text, s(:arglist, s(:str, "Hello")))
    # self << "Hello"
    sexp2 = s(:call, s(:self), :<<, s(:arglist, s(:str, "Hello")))

    # the old approach:
    def like_text?(exp)
      rec_meth = exp[1..2].to_a
      rec_meth == [[:self], :<<] || rec_meth == [nil, :text]
    end

    def text?(exp)
      like_text?(exp) and
      exp[3].length == 2
    end

    # the SexpPath approach:
    query = Q? do
      s(:call, nil,      :text, s(:arglist, wild % :content)) |
      s(:call, s(:self), :<<,   s(:arglist, wild % :content))
    end
{: lang=ruby }

Woah, isn't that powerful? The vertical-bar means "or", `wild` matches
everything, and the percent sign captures the value. Exactly what I want!

## Introducin SexpBuilder

    gem install sexp_builder

Well, SexpPath alone wasn't enough to solve my problem - I had to introduce a
new library. SexpBuilder is a more complete solution to easily match and
replace complex Sexp. Very much like a parser, you define matchers and rules,
and by combining them with a rewriter it was breeze to implement CSS-proxy.

Have a look at [The Dojo][dojo] for documentation and
[Parkaby::Processor][after] for a full example. There's also a
[Andand.rb][andand] for a more traditional example/demo.
