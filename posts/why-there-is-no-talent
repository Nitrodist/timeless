Title: Why there is no talent
Subtitle: ... and there's still only passion

*Note: This is a more scientific follow-up to another essay called ["There is
no talent"](/there-is-no-talent). I recommend you to read that essay first,
make up your mind about it and then continue with this article. At any time,
feel free to [contact me](/comments) if you have any questions or something
to add.*

A few days ago I published an essay called ["There is no
talent"](/there-is-no-talent), which is by far the most popular essay I’ve
written here. The general response seems to be that most people agree
somewhat with the essay, but there’s also a significant group who agree
completely and a smaller group who disagree completely. To be honest, I’m not
surprised that I’ve received so many messages from people who partially or
fully disagree with the previous post because the essay wasn’t really making
a scientific argument, but rather an emotional one.

(snip)

The goal of the "There is no talent" essay was in fact not to convince people
that there really is no such thing as "talent". No, no, no. The point was to
inspire people to forget about prejudices and simply start following their
passion. I’ve received several comments which seem to confirm that not
thinking about talent in general have a positive effect on their life:

From Martin Berntsen:

From Blake Johnson:

While trying to make this simple point, I made several bold statements which
were far from scientifically (or even logically) explained. The fact that
some of these might have been wrong doesn’t really concern me. I wrote the
essay to provoke thoughts, not to tell you what you already knew. If you’ve
found flaws in my logic, that means I’ve done my job.

However, I find the more "scientific" discussion around this topic very
interesting too, and in this essay I will try to sum up the comments and
thoughts I’ve received so far. I’ve essentially based this on emails sent
directly to me and [the comments posted on Hacker News][prev-hn].

## Definitions, definitions, definitions

We can’t discuss anything if we don’t agree what the words mean in the first
place.

Let’s start with *talent*. Talent is usually defined as "a marked innate
ability". The most important words here are *innate* and *ability*. Innate
means that it’s something you’ve born with: something which, straight from
day 1 of your life, is always within your body (even though it might take
some time to materialize). The fact that it’s an ability rules out any
physical attributes (such as weight, height etc) since these are merely
facts. However, these facts can lead to an ability. By being tall you may
have a natural talent for blocking basketball shots. Effectively, this means
that we’ll have to include these as a part of the concept talent.

*Passion* is a little trickier though. The definition which matches what I
mean by passion in these essays must be "boundless enthusiasm" or "a strong
affection or enthusiasm for an object, concept, etc." Passion is when you
continue doing something, not because you have a specific goal in mind
(better grades, impress friends), but because you simply enjoy it.

Now that we have the proper definitions in place, we can try to answer the
original superficial hypothesis presented:

## Is there really such a thing called *talent*?

Short answer: Yes.

Long answer: Trying to prove that "marked innate abilities" don’t exist is
indeed a tricky process. For instance, we can clearly see that most people
have an unique appearance, which implies that at least some parts of our body
are "randomly generated". What makes the brain so special that it should be
universally equal among all humans? Because if it’s it not equal, that means
it’s different and that again leads to the conclusion that some are better
suited to perform specific tasks. Well, because we also include physical
advantages in our concept of talent, we can simply draw the conclusion based
on the fact that some people are taller than other.

The fact that "marked innate abilities" do actually exist isn’t that
interesting. Let’s move over to the real questions:

## How much does talent really matter?

How much does talent really matter? How much can you accomplish without
having a marked innate ability for something? How much can you accomplish if
you have a marked innate ability, but don’t spend your time working on it?

I think we all agree on that in order to end up in the world-class of
anything, everything needs to be a perfect match: Your innate abilities,
working on it from your childhood, family, friends and coaches which always
supports you, and so on. For this discussion, I think it’s fair to say that
we can ignore these exceptional people, but rather focus on the great people.

There’s various ways to become great at something. One way is based "purely"
on your talent. From [donaq][donaq]:

> about basketball. I used to play almost everyday, and there was a team in my
> neighbourhood with a coach I trained with twice a week. Then I met this guy

> the platoon) trained to beat him, but never came close. The interesting thing
> was this one conversation we had where he confessed, "I don't like
> basketball. I only play because I am good."

Another way is based "purely" on environment. From [*The Making of an
Expert*][expert] by K. Anders Ericsson:

> Thirty years ago, two Hungarian educators, László and Klara Polgár, decided
> to challenge the popular assumption that women don’t succeed in areas
> requiring spatial thinking, such as chess. They wanted to make a point about
> the power of education. The Polgárs homeschooled their three daughters, and
> as part of their education the girls started playing chess with their parents
> at a very young age. Their systematic training and daily practice paid off.
> By 2000, all three daughters had been ranked in the top ten female players in
> the world. The youngest, Judit, had become a grand master at age 15, breaking
> the previous record for the youngest person to earn that title, held by Bobby
> Fischer, by a month. Today Judit is one of the world’s top players and has
> defeated almost all the best male players.

Let’s follow Ericsson’s thoughts a bit. In fact, Ericsson has actually done
some great research on this topic. In the paper [*The Role of Deliberate
Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance*][ericsson] from 1993,
Ericsson presents results from several studies about the role of deliberate
practice in the acquisition of expert performance (well, duh). By "expert
performance", Ericsson essentially means what I’ve described as "being great
at something", and "exceptional performance" is pretty close to "exceptional
people".

I highly recommend reading the whole paper, but I’ll try to show you the most
important parts.

> There is a relatively widespread conception that if individuals are
> innately talented, they can easily and rapidly achieve an exceptional
> level of performance once they have acquired basic skills and
> knowledge.

This is sort-of the same conception I was trying to disprove (on an emotional
level). Ericsson follows up with more scientific proofs: He refers to another
study that came to the conclusion that nobody had attained the level of an
international chess master (grandmaster) "with less than about a decade's
intense preparation with the game". On average, for players that started
studying chess after age 11, it took **11.7 years** to reach an international
chess master status. For players that started even earlier, it took **16.5
years**. Even famous chess players such as Bobby Fischer and Salo Flohr needed
about 10 years, only one year "faster" than the average. This "10-year-rule"
has been supported by data from several other fields, including music,
mathematics, tennis, swimming, and long-distance running.

This tells us that even though you might have a big talent for something,
you’ll still have to invest a huge amount of time in order to become great at
it. There’s simply no shortcut for talented people. In the long run, this
means that being talented alone won’t help you to reach expertise, even
though it certainly might help.

Of course, there are several ways you can spend 10 years, and they don’t all
lead to the same place. Ericsson mentions three types of activities:

> Consider three general types of activities, namely, work, play, and
> deliberate practice. Work includes public performance, competitions,
> services rendered for pay, and other activities directly motivated
> by external rewards. Play includes activities that have no explicit
> goal and that are inherently enjoyable. Deliberate practice includes
> activities that have been specially designed to improve the current
> level of performance. The goals, costs, and rewards of these three
> types of activities differ, as does the frequency with which
> individuals pursue them.

He goes on to discuss the differences between these activities. Work
activities are far from optimal as ways to learn because there’s another,
clearly expected outcome from the activity (to get the job done). Play
activities don’t really have a concrete outcome, and therefore they provide
more opportunities for learning. Deliberate practice on the other hand has
improvements in performance as the primary goal, which obviously makes
learning the expected result.

There’s an important difference between just practicing and what Ericsson
calls "deliberate practicing". [mechanical_fish][fish] touches this with his
comment:

Practicing by itself is worthless if you don’t constantly make sure you’re
practicing the right things. This requires both meta-analysis and feedback.
Once again from Ericsson: "In the absence of adequate feedback, efficient
learning is impossible and improvement only minimal even for highly motivated
subjects. Hence mere repetition of an activity will not automatically lead to
improvement in, especially, accuracy of performance."

The biggest problem by learning through work is that exploration is generally
not encouraged. You’re supposed to give the best performance in the least
amount of time, and "hence individuals rely on previously well-entrenched
methods rather than exploring alternative methods with unknown reliability.
The costs of mistakes or failures to meet deadlines are generally great,
which discourages learning and acquisition of new and possibly better methods
during the time of work."

Play activities don’t have the same pressure to perform, so you can more
easily explore and expand your abilities. On the other hand, because there’s
no pressure at all, it’s also easier to continue playing with what you
already know and enjoy. There’s nothing to stop you from taking a break when
it becomes too difficult, and unless you have the mentality to turn play into
deliberate practice, you’ll never get any better.

Based on these thoughts, I believe it’s fair to draw the conclusion that in
many situations, talent has little direct effect on the outcome. And even in
fields where physical advantages are required in order to reach an expert
performance (like sports), you’ll still has to invest a huge amount of time
in it.

## What about passion?

Well, so what does passion have to do with all of this?

I don’t have any scientific papers to refer to, but please follow along
anyway. Imagine that you must invest 10 years of your life in one specific
field of study. *10 years*. Possibly over 10% of your lifetime. What are your
reasons? I would claim that, if we ignore external coercion, you simply need
to have a passion in order to continue practicing and improving. Passion
leads to practicing, and practicing (deliberate at least) leads to skills. I
believe that passion is the only way to became great at something without
affecting your quality of life in a negative way.

But wait a second, couldn’t you consider passion as a talent? By our current
definitions, this is a rather tricky question since it involves yet another
"nature vs nurture" debate. How much can the environment affect our feelings?
How much is decided from the beginning? I’m not even going to consider
discussing this…

## Conclusion

In order to become great or excellent, you must keep practicing. Not mindless
practice of course, but deliberate practice as Ericsson has described.
Depending on the subject, the innate abilities or the physical attributes may
help, but is not essential for reaching an expert performance. In many cases,
having a talent makes no significant differences on the outcome, which
therefore leads to the conclusion that, very often, "there is no talent".

If talent doesn’t matter, what do you need then? Passion, passion and
passion. By following your passion you will not only get better at things,
but your life situation will also improve since you’re doing what you really
want to do. Wonderful, isn’t it?
