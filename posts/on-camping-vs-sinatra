Title: On Camping vs Sinatra
Author: judofyr

Many years ago there was a tiny little <strike>ladybug</strike> Ruby web
framework called [Camping][camping]. Compared Rails' thousands of lines of
code, camping.rb was a tempting alternative for simple applications:

Welcome to the present, where every test framework ships with its own micro
framework. Or was it the other way? Anyway, my point was: With so many
alternatives, why would you want to go Camping? Why not Sinatra?

Some time ago, this discussion started over at the [Hackety Hack][hh] mailing
list, so I decided to chime in and present ***SIX (UNIMPRESSIVE) REASONS
CAMPING IS BETTER THAN YOU WOULD IMAGINE***.

(snip)

Please don't mistake me, this is not ***SIX (UNIMPRESSIVE) REASONS CAMPING IS
BETTER THAN SINATRA*** or even ***SIX (UNIMPRESSIVE) REASONS YOU SHOULD DROP
EVERYTHING YOU HAVE IN YOUR HAND RIGHT NOW AND START USING CAMPING***. All
I'm saying is that Camping gets so many things *right*. Not necessarily in
very few lines of code or very fast, but nonetheless: I look at Camping code
and nod to myself: "Yeah, this is probably the *correct* way to do it".

Of course, this doesn't really matter. If we cared about correctness, we
would program in Haskell, not some language where monkey patching is
acceptable in production code. As long as you're comfortable in Sinatra (or
any other framework), you should continue doing that.

Without any more ado:

    #!/usr/bin/ruby

    THAN YOU WOULD IMAGINE             # 2) ruby camping-vs-sinatra.rb

    reasons.push(COMMUNITY) do %%
      Yes, Sinatra has a big community, but Camping definitely has a great
      community too. Size doesn't always matter. Because there are so few users,
      it means every single issue gets full attention.

      If you're only looking at the GitHub repo or ruby.reddit.com, Camping
      might seem a little dead, but that's because everything happens on the
      mailing lists so it's not always visible from the "outside". (And other
      times, we're simply restin', just waiting for a question, suggestion or
      comment.)

      Besides, I don't allow Camping to disappear. Not because I need it in my
      business or something like that, but because the code is so fucking great.
      I simply won't allow it to die. Therefore I will *always* do my best to
      help people who are camping (just ask Eric Mill on this mailing list).

    reasons.push(UNPOLLUTED) do %%
      In Sinatra it's a norm (whether you use Sinatra::Base or not), in Camping
      it's the law:

          Camping.goes :Blog
          module Blog; end

          Camping.goes :Wiki
          module Wiki; end

      Every application lives under its own namespace. Yes, it requires a few
      more characters, but when you think about it, why *should* we allow are
      apps to run directly under the global namespace? That's surely not how we
      design our other Ruby code. What makes it so different? Shouldn't you for
      instance be able to `require "app"` and `include App::Helpers` somewhere
      else?

      Think of the environment; reduce your pollution!
    %%%%% end

    reasons.push(RESTful) do %%
      A central idea in REST is the concept of a resource, and that you can call
      methods on the resource (in order to get a representation of it). How would
      you apply these ideas in Ruby? What about this?

          class Posts
            def get; end
            def post; end
          end

      I would say this fits the description perfectly. You can instantiate
      instances of this class (with different parameters etc.) for each request,
      and then call methods on it. Guess how it looks in Camping?

          module App::Controllers
            class Posts
              def get; end
              def post; end
            end
          end

      The best part: Camping doesn't care if you use GET, DELETE, PROPFIND or
      HELLOWORD; every method is threated equally. One of the early ideas of HTTP
      was that you could easily extend it with your own methods for your own
      needs, and Camping is a perfect match for these cases!
    %%%%% end

    reasons.push(RUBY) do %%
      Ruby has wonderful features such as classes, inheritance, modules and
      methods. Why should every single DSL replace these features by blocks?
      Often, all they do is to hide details, without improving anything else than
      line count. Let me show you an example:

          get '/posts' do
            # code
          end

      Now answer me:

      1. Where is this code stored?
      2. How do I override the code?
      3. What happens if I call `get '/posts'` again?

      Not quite sure? Let's have a look at Camping:

          module App::Controllers
            class Posts
              def get
                # code
              end
            end
          end

      Since this is just "plain" Ruby, it's much simpler:

      ### 1. Where is this code stored?

      The code is stored as a method, and we can easily play with it:

          Posts.instance_methods(false) # => [:get]
          Posts.instance_method(:get)   # => #<UnboundMethod: Posts#get>
          # Given post.is_a?(Posts)
          post.methods(false)           # => [:get]
          post.method(:get)             # => #<Method: Posts#get>

      ### 2. How do I override the code?

      Just like you would override a method:

          class App::Controllers::Posts
            def get
              # override
            end
          end

          # or, if post.is_a?(Posts)

          def post.get
            # override
          end

      ### 3. What happens if I call `class Posts` again?

      Because Ruby has open classes, we know that it would have no effect at all.

      ------------

      Another advantage of having resources as classes (and not as blocks):

          module IUseTheseMethodsALot
            def get; end
          end

          module App::Controllers
            class Posts
              include IUseTheseMethodsALot
            end

            class Users
              include IUseTheseMethodsALot
            end
          end
    %%%%% end

    reasons.push(NAMING) do %q%
      In Camping you'll have to give every resource a name, while in Sinatra
      they're always anonymous. By giving resources a name you have a way of
      referencing them, which can be very convenient:

          post '/issue' do
            issue = Issue.create(params[:issue])
            redirect "/issue/#{issue.id}/overview"
          end

      Since every resource is anonymous in Sinatra, you're forced to hard-code
      the path. Not very elegant, and it can be a pain to update the code if you
      for instance want to move all urls from issue/ to i/. Camping's solution:

          class Issue
            def post
              issue = Issue.create(@input.issue)
              redirect R(IssueOverview, issue)
            end
          end

      The R method in Ruby returns the URL to a resource (which takes one
      parameter). Camping automatically calls #to_param on the arguments, so you
      can safely pass in ActiveRecord objects too. If you want to change the
      route to IssueOverview, you can do this in *one* place and you're done.

    reasons.push(RELOADING) do %%
          $ camping app.rb
          ** Starting Mongrel on 0.0.0.0:3301

      The Camping Server provides code reloading (so you don't need to restart
      the server while you develop your app) that works out of the box on *all*
      platforms (including Windows). We actually care about our Windows users!
