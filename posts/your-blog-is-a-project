Title: Your blog is a project
Subtitle: .. so why don't you treat it like one?
Author: judofyr

Maintaining a blog is surprisingly more difficult than you would imagine. The
concept is so simple that anyone instantly understands it. The software has
become so easy to work with that anyone can start one in a few minutes.
*Starting* a blog has never been easier, yet keeping it updated still remains
a most demanding task.

The truth is that blogging is often more about structuring and organizing
than actual *writing*. Well, guess what? Successful software development is
*also* often more about structuring and organizing than actual writing, so
why not apply the same tools to your blog as to any other project?

## Deadlines, or: Learn to ship

Who doesn't hate deadlines? Who doesn't want to continually work on something
until it's absolutely perfect and then release it to the world? Deadlines are
often despised because estimation is never perfect and nobody enjoys
pressure, but truth is that pressure is often *required* to get anything
done. Especially when it comes to situations where no one will complain if
you don't get anything done (a new blog, startup or open-source project).

Don't say "I'm going to blog when I have something interesting to tell", say
"I'm going to blog something each Sunday". The implication of this is that
you'll have to **find something interesting to tell every week**. Of course,
this is only a soft deadline: there will be no real consequences for *not*
holding the deadline, but it will turn your blog from a passive project into
an active project which brings it into a whole new level.

Another consequence of setting deadlines (and sticking to them) is that
you'll force yourself to ship. It's so tempting to try to turn every blog
post into a masterpiece, but far to often you get a better result by simply
publishing and taking feedback from there.

Force yourself out of your comfort zone and start *publishing!*

## Issue tracker, or: Nobody's perfect

Software is rarely perfect, and in order to fix bugs you must first identify
and organize them. Issue trackers are an important part of any project, so
why not use it for your blog too? You just got an idea for something to write
about? Sounds like a feature request to me. The RSS feed isn't working
correctly? Sounds like a bug. Don't just make mental notes about your blog,
treat it right a proper project.

Here at Timeless we have [an issue tracker][issues] with tons of "reported"
issues. It's a simple place where I can quickly scribble down new ideas or
just organize known "bugs". Every time I go into "blog mode" I take a look at
that huge list, and I always discover something new. For instance, I had no
idea I was going to write this article until I peeked at the issue list and
thought: "Yep, today I want to write about how you should treat your blog."

An issue tracker is no different than a simple to-do list, so feel free to
use whatever suits you best, but the important part is to actually **write
things down** and don't keep everything in your mind.

## But wait, there's more!

Not really. There isn't more in this article yet. Why? Because I've already
passed my deadline and I *really* need to get this article published. Instead
of listening to the perfectionist inside of me, I'm just going to ship this
little piece of text and rather work on it later.

As always, please [let me know](/comments) what you think about this idea.
