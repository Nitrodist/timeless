Title: Ruby Fishy Edition
Subtitle: A fishy rant about a silly topic
Author: judofyr

In June 2008 I wrote a rant called "Ruby Fishy Edition". It didn't include all
the details and wasn't even particulary well-written, yet it managed to start
an interesting debate about how you should market open-source products to
programmers.

At the moment, you won't find the original rant here, but sometime in the
future I will update this article with more detailed information about my
original rant, how people responded to the rant and what we can learn from the
whole episode.

Please [subscribe](/changelog.xml) if you want to be notified when it's done.
