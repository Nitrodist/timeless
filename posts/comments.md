Subtitle: How commenting works on Timeless

Feel free to send any comments, thoughts or questions to
<timeless@judofyr.net>. If you write something I think the world needs to
know, I will update the article accordingly. If not, we can simply have a
great discussion.

Many of the articles are also posted to sites like [Hacker News][hn],
[ruby.reddit][reddit] and [RubyFlow][rubyflow], so you can check out the
discussions over there.

In addition, Timeless is fully open-source and available at [GitHub][source].
Feel free to [open an issue][issue] if you have any suggestions for
improvements or want me to write about a specific topic.
